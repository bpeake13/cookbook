# Ingredients #
## Egg Wash ##
- 1 Egg
- 1 tbsp. Cold Water

## Roll ##
- 2 tbsp. butter
- 1 bag spinach (about 8 oz.)
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 Puff pastry sheet
- Sliced ham (about 6 slices)
- 6 tbsp. whole grain mustard with grain.
- 4 oz. grated gruyere cheese
- Fleur de Sel (for serving)

# Method #
Preheat oven to 350 F

Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Once melted add spinach and toss until shriveled. Cook until all liquid is gone (about 5 minutes). Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.

Make an egg wash by combining egg and water until combined.

Roll out a puff pastry sheet into a rectangle until about 1/4th inch thick. Rectangle should be around 16in. x 9in. Layout slices of ham on the pastry such that they touch, but do not overlap. Put 6 dollops of mustard evenly distributed over the ham (about 1 tbsp. on each slice). Paint mustard into a thin layer using either a rubber spatula or brush. Sprinkle a layer of gruyere cheese on top of the mustard. Finally place spinach evenly over cheese for one final layer.

Starting from the closest wide edge, lift up the pastry and slowly roll up the pastry like a swiss roll. Roll all the way to the other edge. You should end up with one long roll. 

Paint the outside of the roll with egg wash on all sides. Cut the roll into small pieces, about 3/4 in. each. Place on baking sheet such that the swirl is facing up. Bake for about 45-50 min. or until pastry is a nice golden brown.

Let cool on tray for 5 minutes, then move to a cooling rack. Top with a pinch of fleur de sel before serving for a little extra flavor.

Tip: These can be saved in the fridge and reheated in an oven at 200 F for 10 minutes.
